# Heap Sort in C#

Heap Sort is a sorting algorithm that makes use of the heap data structure. Each time the root element of the heap i.e. the largest element is removed and stored in an array. It is replaced by the rightmost leaf element and then the heap is reestablished. This is done until there are no more elements left in the heap and the array is sorted.
