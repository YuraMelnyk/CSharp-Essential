## Party Planning Program — Cost Estimate for a Dinner Party
* For each person on the guest list there’s a $25 food charge.
* Clients have a choice when it comes to drinks. Most parties serve alcohol, which
costs $20 per person. But they can also choose to have a party without alcohol.
Kathleen calls that the “Healthy Option,” and it only costs $5 per person to have
soda and juice instead of alcohol. Choosing the Healthy Option is a lot easier for
her, so she gives the client a 5% discount on the entire party, too.
* There are two options for the cost of decorations. If a client goes with the
normal decorations, it’s $7.50 per person with a $30 decorating fee. A client can
also upgrade the party decorations to the “Fancy Option”—that costs $15 per
person with a $50 one-time decorating fee
