## .NET Framework

.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages(C#). Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.


## C# Language

  C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C#, but written with the number sign) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018)
 
 ## Syntax
 The core syntax of C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java. In particular:
* Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement.
* Curly brackets are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into classes, and classes into namespaces.
* Variables are assigned using an equals sign, but compared using two consecutive equals signs.
* Square brackets are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.
